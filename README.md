# Comment on comments

Because Material and Cupertino styling is very different, there is a handfull of code that may seem redundant. It probably isn't. The purposefully redundant code will be joined by

```dart
// ios backup
```

For example, it takes a lot of checks to have [ezButton](file:///lib/src/buttons.dart#ezButton) instantly create fraternal twins!
