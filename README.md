# Empathetech Flutter UI <br><br> Build apps for anyone

EFUI is a holistic foundation for digital accessibility.

EFUI :
- **User-Centric Accessibilities**
  - Verified with [TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006598?hl=en) and [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/turn-on-and-practice-voiceover-iph3e2e415f/ios), with enhanced custom semantics for a clearer user understanding.
- **Rich Customization Capabilities**
  - Users revel in the freedom to modify theme colors, styles, and imagery, making your app a canvas for their expressions.
- **Dynamic Styling & Platform Awareness**
  - Thanks to the integration with [Flutter Platform Widgets](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_platform_widgets), your app gracefully adapts to Material or Cupertino aesthetics matching the native OS convention.
- **Responsive Design**
  - A consistent user experience across various screen sizes, tested and affirmed across all seven Flutter platforms.
- **Internationalization Ready**
  - A foundation set for language translations, kicking off with Spanish, making your app globally amiable.
- **Copy-Paste Ready Settings Segment**
  - The example app is crafted to be a robust settings section of "your" next app, ready to be integrated with a simple copy/paste. 

The journey of crafting accessible and highly customizable apps is simplified, yet enriched with EFUI. A testament to whatâ€™s achievable when user-centric design meets developer-friendly implementation.

# Usage

## Setup
*All code below was adapted from the [example app](example/lib/main.dart)*

First, in main, initialize [EzConfig](lib/src/classes/EzConfig.dart)

```Dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  final SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();

  EzConfig(
    /// your [AssetImage] paths for this app
    assetPaths: [],

    preferences: prefs,

    /// your brand colors, custom styling, etc
    customDefaults: {},
  );
  
  SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([
    DeviceOrientation.portraitUp,
    DeviceOrientation.landscapeLeft,
    DeviceOrientation.landscapeRight,
  ]);

  runApp(const EFUIExample());
}
```

then, use an [EzAppProvider](/lib/src/classes/EzAppProvider.dart) in your build (which pairs well with an [EzApp](lib/src/classes/EzApp.dart))

```Dart
class EFUIExample extends StatelessWidget {
  final Key? key;

  const EFUIExample({this.key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return EzAppProvider(
      app: EzApp(
        title: 'EFUI example',
        routerConfig: GoRouter(initialLocation: '/', routes: ...),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

### It's that Ez!

## How it works

When an `EzApp` starts, `EzConfig` generates the app's [theme data](lib/src/functions/ezThemeData.dart), starting with the [defaults](/lib/src/consts/empathetechConfig.dart) gathers the user's [preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) and .

In the code, `EzConfig` has a globally accessible instance that can be used to query the live configuration.

Then, in conjunction with the custom widgets below, `EzConfig` enables user customization

* [EzThemeModeSwitch](lib/src/classes/EzThemeModeSwitch.dart): A toggle for users to switch between light, dark, or system theming.
* [EzDominantHandSwitch](lib/src/classes/EzDominantHandSwitch.dart): Moves common touch points to benefit lefty's when they want it!
* [EzColorSetting](lib/src/classes/EzColorSetting.dart): A user-friendly color picker to update theme colors.
* [EzFontSetting](lib/src/classes/EzFontSetting.dart): An interface for users to select their preferred font from a predefined list.
* [EzSliderSetting](lib/src/classes/EzSliderSetting.dart): A versatile slider widget for numerical customizations of many kinds (margin, padding, spacing, etc).
* [EzImageSetting](lib/src/classes/EzImageSetting.dart): A user-friendly image uploader to update app assets.
  * Not shown in the example app

#### [See them in action](https://www.empathetech.net/#/settings)

There's lots of other cool stuff in EFUI, like [EzRowCol](lib/src/classes/EzRowCol.dart), [EzNotifications](lib/src/classes/EzNotifications.dart), and [EzVideoPlayer](lib/src/classes/EzVideoPlayer.dart)! We think `EzConfig` will hook you in enough to want to explore the rest!

### Planned features
#### That we could use some help with!

- An Ez solution to [internationalization](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
- More EzWidgets with required and/or preconfigured semantics
- Querying [GoogleFonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) rather than relying on a predetermined [list](/lib/src/consts/googleFonts.dart)
