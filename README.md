### **Open UI**
Is a code generator, for starting EFUI powered apps. It is available on all platforms...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Android (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.empathetech.open_ui)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Android (.apk)](https://github.com/Empathetech-LLC/empathetech_flutter_ui/releases/download/11.0.0/open-ui-android.apk)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/open-ui/id6499560244)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Linux (deb)](https://github.com/Empathetech-LLC/empathetech_flutter_ui/releases/download/11.0.0/open-ui-linux.deb)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Linux (rpm)](https://github.com/Empathetech-LLC/empathetech_flutter_ui/releases/download/11.0.0/open-ui-linux.rpm)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[macOS](https://github.com/Empathetech-LLC/empathetech_flutter_ui/releases/download/11.0.0/open-ui-mac.zip)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Windows](https://github.com/Empathetech-LLC/empathetech_flutter_ui/releases/download/11.0.0/open-ui-windows.exe)

<br>Note: Mobile platforms simply save a configuration file that can be used on Desktop.<br>For code generation to work on Desktop, Flutter must be [installed](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

### <br>Beginner tutorials

If you're new to Flutter: welcome! EFUI is full of comments to help you on your path, and the vast majority of Empathetech code is open source. Hard to find better example code than live production code!

And, here are some (unaffiliated) videos you might find helpful.

### <br>Integrating EFUI with existing projects 

No longer has a formal guide. Since 11.0.0, EFUI enables live configuration. Every aspect of an app's theme can be updated on the fly, no restarts required.<br>It's pretty darn efficient too.

However, there is a significant amount of setup/initialization code required to get it working.<br>EFUI consumers have nothing to worry about: there's very little to do to get yourself 11.0.0 ready.<br>However, the setup is no longer optional.

To accommodate the reduced wiggle room, 11.0.0 also reduced the number of external dependencies.<br>EFUI is as vanilla Flutter as possible. After you get your starter kit from Open UI, it should be happy hacking. Whether you're starting something new, or putting on some background noise and getting ready for a copy/paste session.

Please reach out to the [community](mailto:community@empathetech.net?subject=Becoming%20a%20contributor) contact about becoming a contributor. There's never a shortage of ideas, only time!

For example, the README really isn't what it used to be. But, there is little time to polish it up. If you have a knack for documentation, your help would be most welcome.
